        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>    To make the yogurt mix: Whisk together eggs, yogurt, and olive oil in a medium bowl. Set aside. </li>
        <li>    In a large skillet on medium-high heat, sauté the onion, garlic, and ground meat until the meat is cooked and the onions are translucent. </li>
        <li>  In a separate bowl, combine spinach, dill, parsley, cheese, olive oil, salt, and pepper. </li>
        <li>     Mix in meat and onion mixture with spinach and dill mixture. This is your filling. </li>
        <li>        Preheat the oven to 350 F or 180 C. Brush the bottom and edges of a 9x13-inch pan with oil.</li>
        <li>        Separate the phyllo dough into 2 sets (12-14 pieces each) and keep them covered so they don't dry out. Half will go on the bottom of the pie and half will go on the top.</li>
        <li>        Place 2 sheets in the prepared pan and brush lightly with oil. Fold any hanging edges into the center. </li>
        <li>       Set a third phyllo sheet into the greased pan. Using a brush, spread 2-3 tablespoons of the yogurt mix. Fold any hanging edges into the center. </li>
        <li>      Repeat this pattern of 2 phyllo sheets, light oil, 1 phyllo sheet, and yogurt mix until one set of phyllo sheets is used. </li>
        <li>      Once one set is used, spread the filling evenly across the topmost layer. </li>
        <li>      Repeat the earlier pattern until all phyllo sheets are used up. In the top half, you can use less yogurt mix between layers, as you want to save about ½ cup. </li>
        <li>   Using a serrated knife, cut the Börek into 12 even squares.</li>
        <li>      After using all of your phyllo sheets, take the remaining ½ cup of yogurt mixture and pour evenly across the top of the burek. </li>
        <li>   Sprinkle 2 tbsp of sesame or nigella seeds on top. </li>
        <li>    Bake for 35-40 minutes, until golden brown. </li>
        <li>    Let the borek cool for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
